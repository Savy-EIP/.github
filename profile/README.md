# SAVY - Natural way to learn

## Introduction

### What is SAVY?
- Savy is a language learning solution powered with **artificial intelligence (AI)**. Our aim is to simulate as much of the environment as possible for maximum written and spoken interaction with different Echos (AI) where they have mulitples accents and personalities. We offer lessons or discussions to perfect your language. All this will be supervised by your SAVY assistant, who will personalize your course and correct any errors in spelling, syntax, meaning, pronunciation...

### Why SAVY?

- Based on the word **"savvy"** which means "knowledgeable", we remove the "v" to make it a unique name for the applicationa and the assistant, easy to remember and pronounce

### Who are the Echos?

- The Echos are the AI that you will interact with. They are each unique and have their own personality, accent and 3D model.
