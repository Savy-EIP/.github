## **2. Beta Testing Scenarios**

### **2.1 User Roles**

The following roles will be involved in beta testing.

| **Role Name** | **Description**                                                                        |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Admin         | Manages storage settings, accesses all analytics, and applies global storage policies. |
| Employee      | Views personal storage insights and receives file optimization recommendations.        |

### **2.2 Test Scenarios**

For each core functionality, detailed test scenarios are provided below.

#### **Scenario 1: File Analysis Engine**

- **Role Involved:** Admin / Employee
- **Objective:** Ensure the Tidyscore is correctly calculated and displayed.
- **Preconditions:** A set of sample files with various naming conventions, duplicates, and different last-modified dates.
- **Test Steps:**
  1. Upload test files into the system.
  2. Trigger the analysis process.
  3. Verify that each file is assigned a Tidyscore.
  4. Ensure that scores are correctly based on naming conventions, duplicates, and inactivity.
- **Expected Outcome:** Each file receives a correct and justified Tidyscore.

#### **Scenario 2: User Dashboard**

- **Role Involved:** Admin / Employee
- **Objective:** Ensure that users can view their Tidyscore summary and recommendations.
- **Preconditions:** Tidyscore has already been calculated for existing files.
- **Test Steps:**
  1. Log in as a user.
  2. Navigate to the dashboard.
  3. Verify that all relevant analytics (Tidyscore, file health, duplicate alerts) are displayed.
  4. Check that clicking on a recommendation provides relevant details.
- **Expected Outcome:** Users can see their storage insights and interact with optimization recommendations.

#### **Scenario 3: Duplicate Detection**

- **Role Involved:** Admin
- **Objective:** Ensure the system detects duplicate files accurately.
- **Preconditions:** A set of duplicate files uploaded to storage.
- **Test Steps:**
  1. Upload a mix of original and duplicate files.
  2. Trigger the duplicate detection function.
  3. Verify that all duplicates are correctly identified.
  4. Test the deletion or consolidation options.
- **Expected Outcome:** Duplicates are identified and handled appropriately.

#### **Scenario 4: Multi-User Access Control**

- **Role Involved:** Admin / Employee
- **Objective:** Ensure that different user roles have the correct permissions.
- **Preconditions:** A system with at least one Admin and one Employee account.
- **Test Steps:**
  1. Log in as an Admin and attempt to modify system-wide settings.
  2. Log in as an Employee and attempt to modify system-wide settings.
  3. Verify that only Admins can perform administrative actions.
- **Expected Outcome:** Role-based restrictions function as intended.
